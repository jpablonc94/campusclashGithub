# campusclashGithub

Este directorio tiene como objetivo el desarrollo de un plugin para moodle al que llamar√© **CampusClash**.

Post instalation

After you have installed the block you just add it into the moodle course.

    The ranking block works together with the activity completion, so you need to enable that and configure the criterias for all activities you want to monitor. The ranking block monitors these activities and add points to the students based on accomplishing the activities.

Enabling completion tracking

        1/ Go to: Site administration / Advanced features
        2/ Turn on the item "Enable completion tracking"
        3/ Inside the course go to: Course administration / Edit settings
        4/ In the section Completion tracking set "Completion tracking" to yes
        5/ Save
